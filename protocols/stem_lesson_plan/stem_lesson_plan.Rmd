## Learning objectives

- Students will know that arthropods are incredibly diverse
- Students will know that different habitats help contribute to that diversity
- Students will understand what a taxonomic order is
- Students will be able to identify common arthropod orders
- Students will have an appreciation for good lab protocol

## Lesson plan

### Brief presentations (10 min)

- Present the tree of life highlighting arthropods
- Present the Sevilleta LTER and Rio Mora NWR as different habitats
- Present the sampling that was done at each
- Discuss the day's activities
    - sorting arthropods 
    - what is an order?
    - "field marks" for common orders
        - Arachnida
            - Araneae (spiders)
            - Acari (mites)
            - Scorpiones (scorpions)
            - Solifugae (camel spiders)
        - Insecta
            - Coleoptera (beetles)
            - Diptera (flies)
            - Hemiptera (true bugs)
            - Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants)
            - Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths)
            - Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets)
    - discuss the sorting protocol below using an example of an already sorted sample


### Sorting protocol

- Materials
    - Each group of 2--4 students will be given two samples to sort to order, one from the Sevilleta, one from Rio Mora
    - Each sample will be in a ziploc bag containing:
        - the sample itself
        - 4 labeled plastic bowls for dividing the sample as needed
        - 50ml tubes for sorting orders into, each labeled by sampling location and order
        - A data recording sheet
    - In addition to the sample bag, each group will receive:
        - Equipment for processing and cleanup
            - forceps
            - paper towels
            - gloves
            - a squirt bottle of propylene glycol
        - An identification sheet with pictures of the common orders
    - Several dissecting scopes will be available for the groups to share
- Process (15 min x 2)
    - Each group will begin by processing the Rio Mora sample followed by the Sevilleta sample, with cleanup after each sample is processed
    - Processing
        - One person will divide the sample into enough bowls such that each person can sort their own bowl
        - Students will sort through their bowls, picking out individual arthropods, identifying them to order, and placing the identified specimen into the appropriate tube
        - A tally will be kept on the data sheet of how many specimens of each order are found in each sample; these data sheets will be given to the instructor to tabulate
- Cleanup (5 min x 2)
    - all tubes will be capped and returned to their sample bag
    - all bowls will be squirted with the propylene glycol, letting all the fluid drip back into the primary sample container
    - the work area will be wiped down with paper towels
- Discussion (10 min)
    - After all sorting is complete we will discuss as a group any qualitative differences between the Sevilleta and Rio Mora
    - We will quantitatively compare differences in the total number of arthropods and representation of different orders at the two different locations
    - We will take general questions and comments time permitting
