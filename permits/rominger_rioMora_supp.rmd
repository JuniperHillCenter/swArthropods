### 13) Describe project by specifically identifying timing, frequency, and how the project is expected to proceed:

### 14) Specifically identify location(s) and/or attach a map for the project:

We will establish 5 grassland and 2 woodland plots within the polygon shown in Figure X. These plots will be established by generating a random set of candidate sites and then rejecting those sites that are abnormal (e.g. coincide with prairie dog or harvester ant mounds) or are sensitive from a management perspective. The sensitivity of candidate sites will be discussed with Refuge staff.

### 15) Identify species or habitats being studied:

All arthropod species will be considered.  We will focus primarily on grassland habitat, but include a small number of woodland plots for comparison (see map in section 14)

### 16) Purpose/hypothesis:

We are interested in establishing long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and populations in the Southwest.  The purpose of this monitoring is two-fold: First we hope to provide useful information to conservation practitioners about arthropods; second we seek to use these data to test several specific hypotheses including:
- Lat grad
- Restoration grad
- Elevation grad


### 17) Expected benefits of research/monitoring:

### 18) Briefly describe project history and context of research/monitoring project:

### 19) Briefly describe projectâ€™s relationship to other research/monitoring projects either known of or conducted by the applicant:

### 20) Identify the types of specimen collections to be taken (see specimen collection clause in the instruction section #20) or data to be collected during the proposed project:

### 21) List other cooperators and institutions involved in the project:
The Juniper Hill Center (<http://juniperhillcenter.org>)

### 22) Generally identify the anticipated timeline for analysis, write-up and publication:

### 23) For research involving animals, attach an Assurance of Animal Care Form or an approval from an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee? Is a form or approval attached?

No form, not working with vertebrates.

# License/Insurance/Certifications/Permits

### 24a) List and attach copies of any **licenses** you have for equipment operation (i.e., aviation or commercial boats), pesticide applications, transporters) or others if required:

### 24b) List and attach copies of any **insurance** you have (i.e general liability, flight/grounding, contaminants, medical evacuation, or others if required:

### 24c) List and attach copies of any **certifications** you have, such as rat free, hull inspections, CPR/First Aid, or others if required:

### 24d) List and attach copies of any other Federal, State, or Tribal **permits** if required:

### 27a) Provide details and schedule for the installation of instrumentation:

### 27b) Provide details and schedule for the removal of instrumentation:

### 27c) If instrumentation is permanent, describe need:

### 27d) If instrumentation requires a maintenance schedule, describe needs and schedule:

### 27e) Provide a data collection schedule:

### 28) Provide logistical arrangements for offsite transportation of samples:

### 29a) Provide detailed information on the logistics for onsite, intersite, and/or ship-to-shore transportation to or on the refuge, if required:

### 29b) Provide descriptions, license plate and/or identification numbers of vehicles used for onsite transportation, if required:

### 29c) Provide descriptions, license plate and/or identification numbers of vehicles used for intersite transportation, if required:

### 29d) Provide descriptions, license plate and/or identification numbers of vehicles used for ship-to-shore transportation, if required

### 30a) Is fuel cache needed?

No.

### 30b) Provide specific location(s) of fuel caches:

NA

### 31) Attach Safety Plan if required. Is Safety Plan attached?
